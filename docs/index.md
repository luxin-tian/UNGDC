Quantitative revelations of political agentsâ€™ preferences are of substantial interest in the field ofpolitical science. In this project, we employ computational methods to perform a content analysisof the United Nations General Debate Corpus (UNGDC). We infer state preferences for politicalagendas through features embedded in text data and topic modeling, and we examine policy posi-tion proximity between states based on our measurement.  We embed the documented statementsdelivered by countries into a semantic space and infer state blocs based on their policy positionsrepresented by document vectors.  We also present the topics that the states are concerned aboutover the past half-century and investigate international relations in terms of common concerns.Finaly, we evaluate the validity and reliability of our methods and results.
